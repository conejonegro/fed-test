### Getting Started

If you have Node.js installed on your machine, running the
project through `http-server` is an ideal strategy. Open up the project
in any CLI and run the following commands:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Otherwise, simply open the `index.html` file located within the `src` folder
in your favourite web browser.
